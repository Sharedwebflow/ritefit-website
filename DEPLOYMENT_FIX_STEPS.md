# ðŸ”§ Manual Steps to Fix Railway Deployment

## Critical Fix Applied
I've fixed the deployment issue by updating the server to use Railway's dynamic PORT environment variable instead of hardcoded port 5000.

## Manual Steps to Deploy:

### 1. Push the Fix to GitHub
Open a new terminal in Replit and run:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment: Use dynamic PORT environment variable"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Railway
1. Go to your Railway dashboard at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click on the **ritefit.ai** service (not the database)
3. Click the **"Deploy"** button to trigger a new deployment
4. Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete

### 3. Generate Domain URL
Once deployment shows "Deployment successful":
1. Stay in the ritefit.ai service dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Click **"Generate Domain"** button
4. Railway will create your live URL

### 4. Expected Live URL
You'll get something like:
- `https://ritefit-ai-production.up.railway.app`
- `https://noble-success-production.up.railway.app`

## What the Fix Does
- Changed from hardcoded `port = 5000` 
- To dynamic `port = process.env.PORT || 5000`
- Railway sets PORT automatically (usually 3000 or 8080)
- Keeps port 5000 for local development

## Your Website Will Include
- Complete React frontend with smooth animations
- Real founder photos (Venkata, Krishna, Ramesh)
- Professional AI-themed design
- Functional contact forms
- Express.js backend with PostgreSQL database
- All pages: Home, About, Services, Academy, Contact

## Troubleshooting
If still having issues:
- Check Railway build logs for specific errors
- Verify DATABASE_URL is connected
- Ensure all dependencies installed correctly

The port fix should resolve the deployment failure completely.
