# RiteFit.AI - Complete Hostinger Deployment Instructions

## Quick Start Guide

### What You Need:
- Hostinger hosting account
- FTP client (FileZilla) OR Hostinger File Manager
- Your website files (I'll help you get these)

### Step 1: Get Your Website Files

Since you're using Replit, here's how to get your files:

1. **Download from Replit:**
   - Click on the three dots menu (⋮) next to "Files"
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - Extract the zip file on your computer

2. **Important Files to Upload:**
   - `client/src/` folder (all your React components)
   - `client/index.html` 
   - `attached_assets/` folder (your logos and images)
   - `package.json`

### Step 2: Hostinger Setup Options

#### Option A: Static HTML Version (Recommended)
I'll create a simplified HTML version that works perfectly on Hostinger:

**What I'll create for you:**
- `index.html` - Main homepage
- `about.html` - About page  
- `services.html` - Services page
- `academy.html` - Academy page
- `contact.html` - Contact page
- `style.css` - All styling
- `script.js` - Interactive features
- `assets/` - Images and logos

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works on any Hostinger plan
- ✅ Fast loading
- ✅ No server requirements
- ✅ Easy to maintain

#### Option B: Single Page Application (Advanced)
If you want to keep the React version, you'll need:
- Build the React app
- Upload static files
- Configure URL routing

### Step 3: Upload to Hostinger

1. **Login to Hostinger hPanel**
2. **Go to File Manager**
3. **Navigate to public_html folder**
4. **Upload your files:**
   - Upload `index.html`
   - Upload `style.css`
   - Upload `script.js`
   - Upload `assets/` folder
   - Upload all HTML pages

### Step 4: Configure Domain

1. **Point your domain to Hostinger**
2. **Enable SSL certificate** (free with Hostinger)
3. **Test your website**

### Step 5: Contact Form Setup

Since static hosting can't handle form submissions, use:

**Option A: EmailJS (Recommended)**
- Free service for contact forms
- Works with static sites
- Easy to set up

**Option B: Formspree**
- Another good alternative
- Simple integration

## What I'll Do for You

I can create:
1. **Static HTML version** of your entire website
2. **Contact form** that works with EmailJS
3. **All styling** converted to regular CSS
4. **Upload instructions** specific to your files
