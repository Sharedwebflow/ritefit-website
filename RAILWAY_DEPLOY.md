# ðŸš€ Deploy RiteFit.AI to Railway

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it `ritefit-website` or similar
3. Make it public (for easier Railway connection)
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### 2. Connect Local Project to GitHub
```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ritefit-website.git

# Add all files and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: RiteFit.AI complete website"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway
1. **Go to Railway**: Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Sign in** with GitHub account
3. **New Project**: Click "New Project"
4. **Deploy from GitHub**: Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. **Choose Repository**: Select your `ritefit-website` repository
6. **Configure**:
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js project
   - It will read the `railway.json` configuration file
   - PostgreSQL database will be automatically provisioned

### 4. Environment Variables (Auto-configured)
Railway automatically sets:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT` - Application port

### 5. Build & Deploy Process
Railway will automatically:
1. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Build the project (`npm run build`)
3. Start the server (`npm run start`)
4. Provision PostgreSQL database
5. Run database migrations

### 6. Access Your Deployed Site
- Railway provides a unique URL like: `https://ritefit-website-production.up.railway.app`
- Your site will be live with full functionality including:
  - Dynamic React frontend with animations
  - Express.js backend
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Contact forms
  - All founder photos and content
