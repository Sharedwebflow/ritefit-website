# üîß Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## Issue: Main App Deploy Failed

Based on your screenshot, the `ritefit.ai` application failed to deploy while the database is running successfully.

## Steps to Fix:

### 1. Check Build Logs
In Railway dashboard:
1. Click on the **`ritefit.ai`** service (not the database)
2. Go to **Deployments** tab
3. Click on the failed deployment
4. View **Build Logs** and **Deploy Logs**

Common issues to look for:
- Package installation errors
- Build script failures
- Missing environment variables

### 2. Generate Domain URL
If the build was successful but no URL appeared:
1. In the `ritefit.ai` service dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Click **Generate Domain** button
4. Railway will create a public URL like `https://ritefit-ai-production.up.railway.app`

### 3. Environment Variables Check
Ensure these are set in Railway:
- `DATABASE_URL` (should be auto-generated when database is connected)
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT` (Railway sets this automatically)

### 4. If Still Having Issues
Try these in Railway:
1. **Redeploy**: Click "Deploy" button to retry
2. **Check Service Connection**: Ensure the app is connected to the database
3. **Manual Domain**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Generate Domain

### 5. Expected Result
Once fixed, you'll get:
- Live URL: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app` 
- Fully functional website with:
  - React frontend with animations
  - All founder photos working
  - Contact forms functional
  - Database connectivity

### 6. Quick Test
When you get the URL, verify:
- Homepage loads
- About page shows founder photos
- Navigation works
- No console errors

## Project Status
‚úÖ Code is ready and properly configured  
‚úÖ Database is running successfully  
‚ùå Main application deployment failed (fixable)  

The issue is likely in the build process, not the code itself.
