# ðŸš€ Simple Vercel Deployment Fix

## The 404 Error Issue
The 404 error happened because Vercel was looking for the wrong build output. I've simplified the configuration.

## Updated Vercel Settings

### **For your next deployment, use these settings:**

**Build Settings in Vercel Dashboard:**
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`
- **Node.js Version**: 18.x (default)

### **No Environment Variables Needed**
- Remove any environment variables you added
- Your website works without external APIs for now

## Quick Fix Steps

### **Option 1: Update Existing Deployment**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your `ritefit-website` project
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **General**
4. Update:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
5. Go to **Deployments** â†’ **Redeploy**

### **Option 2: Redeploy from GitHub**
1. Push the updated `vercel.json` to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Vercel will auto-deploy the fix

### **Expected Result**
- Live URL: `https://ritefit-website.vercel.app`
- Complete RiteFit.AI website with:
  - Homepage with hero section
  - About page with founder photos
  - Services page with offerings
  - Academy page with training programs
  - Contact page with forms
  - Professional animations and design

## Why This Fix Works
- Uses Vite's default build output (`dist`)
- Matches your existing build script
- Simpler configuration for static frontend
- No complex routing needed

Your website should be live within 2-3 minutes after redeployment!
